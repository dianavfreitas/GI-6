Rock Paper Scissors Game

  I created a rock paper scissors game where you are playing with a computer. You pick an option and the computer will 
  come back with its option, it will display a text wether it's a tie, you win or loose.

  I added a score tracker where you can clearly see by how many points you ar winning/loose/tied.

  I also inlcuded a reset button in case you get tired of seeing by how much you're loosing, you can rest the game and re-start it!
